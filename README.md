# About Me  

This repository contains a copy of the instructions and tips gathered from building the front end of the serverless stack tutorial. The first part of the tutorial focused on the back end and setting up some of the key functionality while the second part focused on creating a front end for the application. 

More information can be found at [Serverless stack](https://serverless-stack.com/)  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
